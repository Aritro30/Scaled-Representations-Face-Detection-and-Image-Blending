# Scaled Representations Face Detection and Image Blending

The purpose of this assignment is to implement and understand the use of normalized cross correlation for object detection in a scaled representations. As well as to experiment with other applications of scaled representations, such as image blending. The questions are [here](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lsigal/425_2020W1/Assignment2.html). The solution is [here](https://github.com/Aritro30/Scaled-Representations-Face-Detection-and-Image-Blending/blob/main/CPSC425Assignment2.ipynb)
